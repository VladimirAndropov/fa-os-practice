Workshop. Shell Programming. Part 1.

__TODO__: Rewrite. Source is [here](https://uneex.ru/HSE/ArchitectureOS/Lab_00_OverviewShell).
-->

Create `00_OverviewShell` directory. All code must reside there.

#### Script: executable text file

* Can be executed with "`interpretator script_file`"
   * e. g. `sh script`
* «Shebang» (`#!/bin/sh` at the first line)
   * `chmod +x script` 
   * ⇒ can be executed via `./script`
* Run by name if it's directory is in `$PATH` variable
   * `PATH=`''`directory_with_script`''`:$PATH` 
   * ⇒ can be executed via just `script`

## Tasks

1. Simple script file named `c1`:

   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   read A
   echo $A
   ```

2. `A` is variable.

3. `$A` is a "substitution" of `A` value.

4. `echo` command is executed "after" substitution, so

   * If called as

         sh c1   ABC      def  123

     it outputs

         ABC def 123

     without extra spaces, because `echo $A` expands to `echo ABC      def  123`,
     which is command `echo` with three command line parameters.

5. (!) How to make `echo` display all spaces as well?
   <!---  Spoiler: 
   /* use `sh c1 "  ABC      def  123"` form — it constructs ''one''
     parameter instead of three with all the words and spaces in it
   */
   -->
   * fix `c1` to do this

6. Output substitution, `c2` file

   ```bash
   #!/bin/sh
   read A
   Sys=`uname`
   echo "Hello, $A!
   Welcome to $Sys!"
   ```

   * The «\`command\`» (also «\`$(command)\`») construction runs `command`
     and substitutes it with its output.
   * "No" spaces is allowed around «`=`» when assigning.
   * All variables are strings.
   * (!) Modify `c2` not to read `A`,
     but to output user login name instead (use `logname` or `whoami` command).

<!---

 1. Multiline
  * `echo $A` squeezes all newlines as well
  * If you want to use control characters like in C, use [[man1:echo|echo -e]] key
  * (!) Write a `c4` script that 
   * ends with command `echo -e "$Msg"`
   * outputs
   {{{
Hello, your_login_name!
Welcome to Linux
}}}
   * and contains only one two extra lines:
    * one shebang
    * and one like `Msg=…something…`
   * make this script executable
 1. Commandline parameters. This is `c5` file:

```shell script
#!/bin/sh

echo "$0"
echo "$1"
# ...
echo "$*"
echo "$#"
```

  * `$1`, `$2` … — command line argument №1, №2 …
  * `$0` — name of the script itself
  * `$*` — ''all'' command line arguments
  * `$#` — number of command line arguments
  so

```shell script
[tmpuser@sugon 00_OverviewShell]$ sh c5 A bc  cde   fff
c5
A
A bc cde fff
4
```

 1. Conditional `if` operator.
  * Overview:

```shell script
if condition-conmands
then
  true-commands
else
  false-commands
fi
```

   * if last of `condition-conmands` exit with success status (zero status code), `true-commands` are executed.
   * otherwise, if last of `condition-conmands` exit with `non-zero` exit status (an error), `false-commands` are executed.
   * '''Yes''', 0 status is `true`, non-0 is `false`!
   * Yes, `fi` is `if` backwards
  * Example `c6` file:

```shell script
#!/bin/sh
if ls $*; then
        echo YES
else
        echo NO $?
fi
```

   * if `ls` is successful, echoes `YES`, otherwise `NO`
   * «`$?`» — is exit status of failed command
  * using `2> /dev/null` to redirect error messages out of terminal:

```shell script
$ ls c6
c6
$ ls c6 > o
$ ls c100500
ls: cannot access 'c100500': No such file or directory
$ ls c100500 > oo
ls: cannot access 'c100500': No such file or directory
$ ls c100500 2> oo
$ cat o
c6
$ cat oo
ls: cannot access 'c100500': No such file or directory
```

  * (!) Rewrite `c6` file (copy it to `c7`)
   * To output content of `ls` ''after'' «YES» message, if ls is successful
   * Not to output error message if `ls` is not successful

-->

## Homework

### Research

* What exit status the command `read` generates? Try it.

   * _Important_: Please consult `help read`
     (e. g. [here](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/bash.html#index-read)) 
     command instead of `man read`, because `read` is shell built-in and you got
     manual page on _all_ shell builtins.

   * How to suppress «`\n`» output after `echo`
     (see [man7](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/echo.1p.html))?

### Task

Write a `c8` script that asks user for name, and prints a welcome message either
if an user has entered a name or not:

```bash
$ ./c8
Enter your name: Spot
Hello, Spot!
$ ./c8
Enter your name: 
Hello, tmpuser?
```

Hint: In second example, user had ''not'' pressed «Enter».
